#Exploratory Analysis

#1 Check dimensions
dim(flights_df) #336776 observations for 19 variables

#2 Check Head - first few rows
head(flights_df) #Nothing strange about results

#3 Check Tail - last few obseravtions
tail(flights_df) #NA's in some time columns - Do they suggest flight cancellation?

#4 Summary statistics of data
#Checking min, max and range of dep, arrival time variables
summary(flights_df) # NA's found in several columns like dep_time & sched_dep_time 

#5 Checking variable datatypes of flights_df
str(flights_df)

#6 How many distinct carriers, flights, origin, destinations in the dataset? 
unique(flights_df$carrier)          #16 carriers
length(unique(flights_df$flight))   #3844  distinct flights that flew out of NYC in 2013
unique(flights_df$origin)           #3 Origin - EWR, LGA, JFK
length(unique(flights_df$dest))     #105 distinct entries in destination column

#7 How many missing values in each variable?
sapply(flights_df, function(fun) { sum(is.na(fun))}) #Total number of NA's in all columns

#8 How many flights went out early or otherwise in each airport?
